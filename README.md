# QuantumBookstoreFullTest
Quantum Bookstore is a Java OOP-based system for managing various book types: PaperBooks (shippable), EBooks (emailed), and ShowcaseBooks (not for sale). The design follows clean OOP principles and ensures full extensibility to support adding new book types without modifying existing logic.
